Flight Price Prediction is a rapidly growing application of machine learning that allows users to predict the price of a flight based on various factors such as flight details, historical pricing data, and market trends. It is particularly useful for travelers who want to plan their travel budgets in advance and make informed decisions about booking flights. With the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, flight price prediction has become more accurate and efficient than ever before. A number of companies have developed machine learning models that can accurately predict flight prices, and many of these models are now available as web applications. These web applications allow users to input their travel details and receive accurate predictions of flight prices, giving them a competitive edge in planning their travel budgets. Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications in Python, and it is particularly well- suited to building machine learning-powered applications such as flight price prediction. By using Flask to build a web application, developers can create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their travel details and receive accurate predictions of flight prices. The resulting application is an effective tool for travelers looking to plan their travel budgets and make informed decisions about booking flights.
